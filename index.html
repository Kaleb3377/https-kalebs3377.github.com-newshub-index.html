<h2>From Nothing to Something- <br>By Kaleb.S

<p>The Rib Lake/Prentice Hawks have continued to shine this 2024 cross country season. Their top runner Kaleb Scott says, "<i>Up to this point me along with the top 3-4 runners have run almost 645 miles since June. This has all been done for the success you see now. We had to build a physical base in our bodies,so we could allow our bodies to function better under stress. And thats exactly what we did. Running back to back 8 mile or even 10 mile days for 3 months. So that once season hit, 3.1 miles would be nothing.</i>"</p>

<p>Last year at this point the Hawks had only 2 wins, but this time a year later they are undefeated. After facing some of the toughest teams in the entire state of Wisconsin the Rib Lake/Prentice Hawks have remained victorious.
</p>    Coming off there most recent win at the <b> 68th Annual Smiley Invitational Meet</b> The Hawks defeated 33 full teams with a roster no one saw coming. With their top 3 runner- Kaleb Scott and the two Regier brothers Jack and Henry, having rough races, their next 4,5,6 runners had amazing races, allowing the Hawks to have another succesful win with 34 points.
